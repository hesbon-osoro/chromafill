## üîç Why Don't I See the Eyedropper Feature?

The eyedropper tool is a handy feature that lets you pick colors directly from your screen. However, this feature requires a modern browser that supports the **EyeDropper API**.

**If you don't see the eyedropper:**

- You might be using an older browser
- You might be using Safari (which doesn't yet support this feature)
- Your browser may have security restrictions preventing this feature

**To use the eyedropper:**

- Try updating to the latest version of Chrome, Edge, or Firefox
- Ensure you're using a supported browser

Don't worry though - you can still manually enter any color code or use our color picker even without the eyedropper feature!

- Desktop computers (Windows, Mac, Linux)
